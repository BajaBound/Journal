Created new branches to work on different parts of the site without disturbing main (i.e, "components", "pages") - be sure to keep main as a working file.  Main should never be broken and a deployment only comes from main and no other branch.

```python

git switch â€“c <name of branch>
```
The file was created using a winesapi file from the 4th day of week 21.  This had the backend set up with all the containers and db. It also had a rough front end. 

I played around with styling.  Changed the titel and color of the background which is in index.css.

I added .jpg of some cat paws to the home page.  I had to add the .jpg to the assets folder and then created an image on the app.jsx. # I may change this to the home page and refer to the homepage from app.jsx.
